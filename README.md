### pppcpp
Programming Principles and Practice using C++

#### Nots for myself

Compile with `g++ -Wall -Wextra -Werror -o output-filename.out` (and a list of the .cpp files)  

I don't use the header file mentioned in the book and provided on the website because it's bad practice and makes the compiler cry.

File naming scheme: chapter, type, exercise number, name  
possible types are:
* d: drill
* t: try this
* e: exercises
